# Flipnux - the most advanced flipdot OS

This OS is currently only compatible with [fluepdot](https://gitlab.com/fluepke/fluepdot).

## Setup

The code is developed under `Python 3.8.3`. It is recommended to use the native `venv` feature during development.

 - Clone and install requirements:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:kryptokommunist/flipnux.git
   cd flipnux
   python3 -m venv .
   source bin/activate
   ```
 - Run it with `python3 main.py`
